# The PushApp

An app created with Flutter and Supabase + Firebase that allows users to group up and begin a "BeReal" like game where a user will receive an incrementing pushup token every three hours. Users must post a photo of themselves wherever they did their pushups.

The backend was created using Supabases PostgREST API, which allowed me to create this project in the span of a couple weeks, although I certainly do not see how their API could be used for scaling more complex projects. It is free storage and database however, so suitable for a small project like this I wanted to use with my friends.

This app was released for beta and tested on the Apple App Store.

Currently, the app is not available for download and posted here on GitHub for reference on Supabase, Flutter and Apple deployment and integration. All keys and tokens have been taken down from Supabase/Firebase
